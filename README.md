This is a work in progress.

Years ago, in a Finance class, I came upon the Yield to Maturity formula for a bond.  I could solve for all variables using
algebra except one: interest (r).

After progressing in my mathematics regimen and learning some new calculus, I discovered the tool I needed.
Newton's Method of Approximation.

I previous performed the calculus on the Yield to Maturity formula and tested its efficacy in Excel.  
This venture is to rewrite the algorithm in Python and make a program that will solve for any variable given the others.

The  attached Excel and Word files are my original work from 2019.
